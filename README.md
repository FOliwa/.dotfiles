# dotfiles motivation

Repository where I store my configuration for tools I use every day.
The idea here is to be able download it run one script and be ready to go ASAP on
any LINUX (at this moment Ubuntu based) systems.

Those configurations are to terminal based tools I can deploy and use at any server machine (with no GUI)

# Usage
1. First step = download the repo into your $HOME directory
2. Run `deploy.sh` script
3. Run `sync.sh` if you made changes in configs at your system and want to populate it to this repo 
```

## TODO:
- Test it out - check if all script works as expected on fresh Linux system

## NOTES:
to make nvim aware of django models and types install django-stubs package
`pip install django-stubs`
`pip install django-types`
